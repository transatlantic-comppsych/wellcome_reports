Report authors: Stringaris A (UCL, PI), Payne M (UCL, post-doc), Spencer L (Oxford, post-doc), Bagdades E (UCL, research assistant), Delpech R (UCL, research assistant), Norman J (UCL, research assistant), Tromans N (Oxford research assistant), Z Kokan (Oxford research assistant), Krebs G (UCL, Co-I), Leigh E (Oxford, Co-I), Singh I (Oxford, Co-I).

## **Progress made over the past twelve months**

We have made good progress towards our goals as indicated by the following:

-   Three research assistants have joined the team. Ms Raphaelle Delpech (15/04/24), with a background in psychology and neuroscince and Ms Jessica Norman (28/05/24), with a background in biology, psychology and clinical experience, have joined through UCL. Ms Zeba Kokan (19/09/24), with a background in brain and behavioural sciences and global studies, has joined through Oxford. We have weekly inter-disciplinary meetings between the UCL and Oxford sites. Please see Fig 1 depicting some of the members of the team.

-   **Young People's Advisory Group (NeurOX YPAG)**

    The NeurOX YPAG has played an invaluable role in developing research for the Surprise Project. The YPAG is comprised of 33 young people aged 14-23 from a range of backgrounds and ethnicities.

    For the Authenticity & Impression Management sub-study, the YPAG has helped develop an interview guide and has advised on the terminology that would be most accessible to young people participating in this study. YPAG members have also participated in trial runs of the interview guide, which has been adapted according to their feedback.

-   **Development of Cognitive Tasks**

    We've made significant progress in developing novel cognitive tasks for our projects. In particular, we've created a task that simulates the experience of social interactions. Through this task, we've already demonstrated a robust relationship between prediction errors and both mood and anxiety.

-   **Online Recruitment of Participants (18-25 years)**

    We have recruited 1837 participants via Prolific. This includes participant recruitment for piloting during task development as well as recruitment of our final participant samples.

-   **Community Recruitment of Participants (18-25 years)**

-   **School Recruitment of Participants (14-18 years)**

## **Preliminary findings and/or key discoveries**

### Surprise Task

We have collected data using the surprise task from the following groups: young adults between the ages of 18-25 through Prolific, young adults between the ages of 18-25 through local community recruitment, and students between the ages of 14-18 through school recruitment.

In a first set of analyses we used Linear Mixed Effects (LME) models to look at the relationship between social surprises or prediction errors (PEs) and momentary mood and anxiety. Specifically, we tested various models with different random effects structure as well as some that included trait social anxiety scores (mini SPIN scores) as a co-variate and some that didn't.

-   **Online recruitment (n=29)**

    -   The best fitted LME for mood and prediction error was the following $Mood  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was 0.27 (95%CI = 0.16 - 0.38).

    -   The best fitted LME for anxiety and prediction error was the following $Anxiety  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was -0.15 (95%CI = -0.23 - -0.08).

-   **Local community recruitment (n=45)**

    -   The best fitted LME for mood and prediction error was the following $Mood  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was 0.19 (95%CI = 0.12 - 0.27).

    -   The best fitted LME for anxiety and prediction error was the following $Anxiety  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was -0.07 (95%CI = -0.11 - -0.03).
