Report authors: Stringaris A (UCL, PI), Payne M (UCL, post-doc), Spencer L (Oxford, post-doc), Bagdades E (UCL, research assistant), Delpech R (UCL, research assistant), Norman J (UCL, research assistant), Tromans N (Oxford research assistant), Z Kokan (Oxford research assistant), Krebs G (UCL, Co-I), Leigh E (Oxford, Co-I), Singh I (Oxford, Co-I).

## **Progress made over the past twelve months**

We have made good progress towards our goals as indicated by the following:

-   Three research assistants have joined the team. Ms Raphaelle Delpech (15/04/24), with a background in psychology and neuroscince and Ms Jessica Norman (28/05/24), with a background in biology, psychology and clinical experience, have joined through UCL. Ms Zeba Kokan (19/09/24), with a background in brain and behavioural sciences and global studies, has joined through Oxford. We have weekly inter-disciplinary meetings between the UCL and Oxford sites. Please see Fig 1 depicting some of the members of the team.

-   Dr Daniel Rautio will be joining the team from August 2025 through July 2027, and work on WP4 and WP5, through a starting grant from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare; Forte. This grant of approximately £300,000, divided over a period of three to four years, is intended to promote establishment and independence in research by providing junior researchers with the opportunity to conduct their own research project. Dr Rautio is an experienced psychologist and psychotherapist that has been responsible for the care of patients with body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) at the specialist obsessive-compulsive and related disorders clinic within the child and adolescent mental health services in Stockholm, Sweden, since the opening in 2015. He has taken the lead at evaluating and refining the clinic’s treatment manual for BDD, in collaboration with colleagues at the Maudsley Hospital in London, UK. He has also been in charge of building the clinic’s database of cases with paediatric BDD, which is one of the largest cohorts of BDD cases in the world. Further, he has led the first treatment trial evaluating internet-delivered CBT for children and adolescents with BDD. Having just finished his PhD, Dr. Rautio is already an established BDD researcher, and has published several studies of high quality in the field.

-   **Development of Cognitive Tasks**

    We've made significant progress in developing novel cognitive tasks for our projects. In particular, we've created a task that simulates the experience of social interactions. Through this task, we've already demonstrated a robust relationship between prediction errors and both mood and anxiety.

    -   Maddy's tasks (storytelling task)

    -   MDoT?

-   **Online Recruitment of Participants (18-25 years)**

    We have recruited 1837 participants via Prolific. This includes participant recruitment for piloting during task development as well as recruitment of our final participant samples.

-   **Community Recruitment of Participants (18-25 years)**

-   **School Recruitment of Participants (14-18 years)**

-   **Development of Research Protocol for "Impression management and Authenticity" sub-study**

    -   This sub-study is lead by Dr Lucienne Spencer and will aim to answer the following research question: "How does 'impression management' impact young people with social anxiety disorder (SAD)?"

    -   We hypothesise that impression management will have more negative impacts on young people’s ‘authentic self’ than overall positive impacts.

    -   This study will: 

        1.   Investigate the negative and positive impacts of impression management on young people with SAD.  

        2.  Analyse the balance of negative and positive impacts of impression management on this population 

        3.   Investigate how impression management impacts a young person’s authentic self. This will include refining the concept of ‘authenticity’ for young people that best maps onto their intuitions.  

    -   We will conduct 1:1 Semi-structured phenomenological interview of 40-50 young people with SAD, aged between 14 and 18 over Zoom. The interview will be approximately 2.5 hours. We have chosen to have the interview over Zoom because our participants have social anxiety disorder, and an in-person session would impact recruitment.  

-   **Progress on understanding the role of self-processing variables (self-focused attention, safety behaviours, and negative self-image) in producing or maintaining symptoms of social anxiety disorder**

    -   This effort is led by Naomi Tromans and involves:

        1.  A Systematic review and meta-analysis looking at the types of manipulations which have been used to experimentally alter these self-processing variables, and the effects of enhancing or reducing them on self-reported state anxiety and/or observer-reported anxious appearance across the lifespan.

            -   Working towards this, a pre-registration has been published on Prospero (CRD42024554587 Available from:  <https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024554587>) outlining eligibility criteria, search strategy, and analysis plans.

            -   The review is currently nearing the end of full text screening.

        2.   Development of a qualitative sub-study investigating the subjective experience of self and external foci of attention in a sample of anxious adolescents.

            -   This study utilises an element of Cognitive Therapy for Social anxiety, the self-focused attention and safety behaviours experiment. This experiment is used early in treatment and has been shown to effectively reduce state social anxiety. It involves the patient, or in this case participant, having one conversations being highly self-focused and using their safety behaviours, and another being externally focused and dropping these behaviours.

            -   The qualitative interview aims to understand the subjective experience of each conversation, what works about the instructions or delivery to manipulate self-processing and to alter state anxiety. It also goes on to ask about experiences of these different modes of attention more generally in everyday life.

            -   Progressing towards this, a protocol has been developed and piloted with YPAG members, along with the interview topic guide and in-session VAS measures, e.g. of state anxiety, perceived performance, and the occurrence and quality or negative self-imagery.

            -   An ethics amendment was submitted and recruitment is intended to begin in January.

    **Progress on WP3: identifying the neural markers of social interactions and mood**

    -   We have submitted and received approval from UCL Ethics to record EEG and MEG data simultaneously with performance on cognitive tasks in participants aged 16-25 years, following the same recruitment pathways currently in place.

    -   MEG and EEG are non-invasive functional imaging techniques with a high temporal resolution allowing us to track the neural underpinnings of trial-by-trial changes in social surprises and participant self-reported mood. The high temporal resolution of these tools will allow us to look at neural responses during (and in the milliseconds following) the presentation of social feedback to participants.

    -   In the next year, lab members based at UCL will undergo training for these methods, including safety practices, and we will work on adapting the tasks for EEG/MEG implementation.

### Surprise Task

We have collected data using the surprise task from the following groups: young adults between the ages of 18-25 through Prolific, young adults between the ages of 18-25 through local community recruitment, and students between the ages of 14-18 through school recruitment.

In a first set of analyses we used Linear Mixed Effects (LME) models to look at the relationship between social surprises or prediction errors (PEs) and momentary mood and anxiety. Specifically, we tested various models with different random effects structure as well as some that included trait social anxiety scores (mini SPIN scores) as a co-variate and some that didn't.

-   **Online recruitment (n=29)**

    -   The best fitted LME for mood and prediction error was the following $Mood  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was 0.27 (95%CI = 0.16 - 0.38).

    -   The best fitted LME for anxiety and prediction error was the following $Anxiety  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was -0.15 (95%CI = -0.23 - -0.08).

-   **Local community recruitment (n=45)**

    -   The best fitted LME for mood and prediction error was the following $Mood  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was 0.19 (95%CI = 0.12 - 0.27).

    -   The best fitted LME for anxiety and prediction error was the following $Anxiety  \sim  social\ PE + mini\ SPIN\ score + (social\ PE | Participant\ ID)$. The coefficient for the main effect of social PE on mood was -0.07 (95%CI = -0.11 - -0.03).

-   **School recruitment (n=)**

    -\> NOTE: waiting for this round of student participants to complete before running analysis

In a second set of analyses, we are also currently in the process of developing and testing various computational models to be fitted on the data from the surprise task, with the hope that these will provide a more thorough understanding of the underlying cognitive mechanisms.

### **The Surprise Intervention in Social Anxiety Disorder: A Phenomenological Account** 

-   This study uses a phenomenological approach to reveal the complex dimensions and the subtle therapeutic benefits of the surprise intervention for those with social anxiety disorder. In recent years, the term ‘phenomenology’, when applied to the field of psychiatry, has often been misappropriated to merely refer to the first-person expressions of an individual or group. Rather, phenomenology is a stringent methodology that seeks to examine the most foundational experiential phenomena. This includes temporal and spatial experiences, a sense of self and agency, one’s experience of other people and overall attunement to the world.  Psychiatric disorders are not limited to the mind but impact one’s entire perception of the world. Therefore, we require such phenomenological tools to access some of the more abstract aspects of psychiatric disorders and to design their accompanying interventions. First, we establish that surprise intervention can force a reflective process, akin to the epoché. We propose that surprise can act as an intellectual tool for the person with social anxiety disorder and can trigger a profound re-evaluation of implicitly held assumptions, namely the negative evaluations they assume to receive from others. Second, we identify that surprise can elicit a transformation in one’s experience of the self and the world. We provide a phenomenological account of the shift in attention from self to external, which is a central feature of Clark and Wells's cognitive behavioural model. This phenomenological account of the surprise intervention reveals the complex ways in which the intervention impacts the individual.

## **Lived Experience**

-   **Young People's Advisory Group (NeurOX YPAG)**

    The NeurOX YPAG has played an invaluable role in developing research for the Surprise Project. The YPAG is comprised of 33 young people aged 14-23 from a range of backgrounds and ethnicities.

    For the Authenticity & Impression Management sub-study, the YPAG has helped develop an interview guide and has advised on the terminology that would be most accessible to young people participating in this study. YPAG members have also participated in trial runs of the interview guide, which has been adapted according to their feedback.

    For the subjective experience of self-focused attention sub-study, the YPAG has helped pilot the study procedure, providing feedback on content of instructions and interviews, on session structure and length, and on session intensity.
